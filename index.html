            <p class="blog-p">All things are possible If you believe, is the
                saying correct?
                <br>
                If you try, everything is possible, it basically
                means that if you want to do something
                good, all the obstacles that will come, can
                be removed. Because, we cannot do many
                things in life for lack of effort. We always
                think, I don't have the skills, Im not
                qualified, therefore I can't. But, it is not right
                at all! If you read the life stories of
                successful people like Bill Gates, APJ Abul
                Kalam Azad, Edison, Einstein, it is known
                that they faced obstacles every step of the
                way. But never retreated. Because, they
                tried, and they succeeded by trying!</p>

                                considered herself a climber.

                                People can kill me, they can torture me.
